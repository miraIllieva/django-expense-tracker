This is a personal expense tracker web application built using Django. It helps users record and view their daily spending. The purpose of this project was to learn and practice Django fundamentals, including working with models, forms, templates, and basic CRUD functionality in a real-world scenario.

The main features include the ability to add expenses with fields for date, category, amount, and description. All expenses are displayed in a styled table layout. The data is stored locally using SQLite. Form validation is handled using Django Forms, and the app layout is styled with basic custom CSS.

Technologies used in this project include Django (Python), SQLite for the database, HTML5 and CSS3 for the front-end, and Git + GitHub for version control. The entire project was developed using PyCharm Community Edition.
